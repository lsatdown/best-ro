## Design Suggestions
1) In the desktop version I would have hover effects on the top navbar: perhaps something simple like an underline and the color changing to a darker grey.

2) In the desktop version I would also have hover effects on the grid. The background should change colour and a transparent image should zoom up from the bottom to fill the grid background. There would be a sentence summarising what the Service is and a link to another section of the website. In the mobile version I would make the dividers between the grid sqaures more obvious, and have each section navigate to the relevant page when tapped.
